</FeatureCard>

## How to Use These Features

### Adding Prefixes and Suffixes

In the conversion settings, you'll find new options to add text before (prefix) or after (suffix) your image filenames. This is especially useful when processing large batches where you need consistent naming conventions.

### Viewing Metadata

Right-click on any image in Picmal and select "Show Metadata" to view detailed information about your images. This includes camera settings, GPS data (if available), color space information, and more.

<ProTip>
Use prefixes like "web_" for images destined for web use, or "print_" for high-resolution print files. This makes it easy to organize your converted images by their intended purpose.
