## What's New in v1.0.4

- **Metadata Removal Option:** Protect your privacy by removing EXIF data, ICC profiles, GPS coordinates, and other metadata from your images during conversion.
- **Improved Window Resizing:** Better handling of window resizing with smoother animations and more
  responsive layout adjustments.
- **AVIF Corruption Fix:** Fixed a critical issue where AVIF images could become corrupted during batch
  conversion processes.

## Privacy-First Metadata Management

This update reinforces Picmal's commitment to privacy. The new metadata removal feature gives you complete control over what information remains in your converted images.

### What Metadata Can Be Removed?

- **EXIF Data:** Camera settings, timestamps, device information
- **GPS Coordinates:** Location data embedded in photos
- **ICC Profiles:** Color management profiles
- **XMP Data:** Adobe metadata and keywords
- **IPTC Data:** Copyright and authorship information

### Enhanced AVIF Support

AVIF is one of the most efficient modern image formats, offering superior compression compared to JPEG and PNG. This update ensures reliable AVIF conversion, especially important for web developers and content creators working with large image collections.

<ProTip>
  When sharing images online or with clients, consider removing metadata to
  protect sensitive information. Picmal's metadata removal happens locally on
  your Macâ€”your images never leave your device.
