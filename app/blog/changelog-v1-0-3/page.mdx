## What's New in v1.0.3

- **SVG Format Support:** Convert vector graphics to raster formats while maintaining crisp quality. Perfect for converting icons and illustrations to PNG or JPEG.
- **40% Faster Conversions:** Optimized conversion engine delivers significantly faster processing times, especially noticeable with large batches and high-resolution images.
- **Memory Usage Improvements:** Reduced memory footprint by 30% when processing large images, allowing for
  smoother operation on older Mac models.

## Performance Improvements

This update focuses on making Picmal faster and more efficient. Whether you're converting a single high-resolution image or processing hundreds of files, you'll notice the improved speed and responsiveness.

### What's Been Optimized?

- **Conversion Engine:** Core image processing algorithms have been rewritten for better performance
- **Memory Management:** More efficient handling of large files reduces system impact
- **Batch Processing:** Parallel processing for multiple files when system resources allow
- **UI Responsiveness:** Interface remains smooth even during intensive conversion tasks

### New SVG Support

Vector graphics are now supported as input format. This is particularly useful for designers who need to convert SVG icons or illustrations to raster formats for different use cases.

**Supported SVG Features:**

- Basic shapes and paths
- Text elements (converted to outlines)
- Gradients and solid fills
- Stroke properties

<ProTip>
  When converting SVG files, you can specify custom output dimensions to ensure
  your converted images are exactly the size you need. This is perfect for
  creating different icon sizes from a single SVG source.
