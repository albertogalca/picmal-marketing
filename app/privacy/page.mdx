## Our Privacy Commitment

At Cantimplora Studio, LLC, privacy is not an afterthought—it's fundamental to how Picmal is designed and operates. This Privacy Policy explains our unwavering commitment to protecting your privacy and how we handle information when you use Picmal.

<ProTip>
**Privacy by Design**: Picmal processes all images locally on your Mac. No images, personal data, or usage information ever leaves your device or reaches our servers.
</ProTip>

## What We Don't Collect

Picmal is designed to collect **absolutely nothing**. We do not gather, store, process, or transmit:

### Personal Information
- Names, email addresses, or contact details
- Device identifiers or system information
- Location data or IP addresses
- User accounts or login credentials

### Usage Data
- Which images you convert or process
- How frequently you use the application
- Feature usage statistics or analytics
- Error reports or crash logs
- Any behavioral or usage patterns

### Technical Data
- System specifications or hardware details
- Operating system information
- Network activity or internet usage
- File paths or directory structures
- Image metadata or EXIF data

## How Picmal Protects Your Privacy

### Complete Local Processing
- **No Internet Required**: Core functionality works entirely offline
- **Local Storage Only**: All processed images remain on your Mac
- **Zero Data Transmission**: Nothing is sent to external servers
- **Private by Default**: No configuration needed for privacy protection

### Secure Image Processing
- **Memory Safety**: Images are processed in secure memory spaces
- **No Temporary Cloud Storage**: All processing happens locally
- **Format Agnostic Privacy**: Protection applies to all 20+ supported formats
- **Metadata Preservation**: EXIF data handling respects your preferences

## Website Analytics (Separate from App)

Our marketing website (picmal.app) uses **Plausible Analytics**, a privacy-focused analytics service that:

✅ **Does not use cookies** or persistent identifiers  
✅ **Does not track individual users** across sessions  
✅ **Provides only aggregated data** about page views and traffic  
✅ **Complies with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR** regulations  
✅ **Does not share data** with advertising networks or third parties  
✅ **Uses no personal identifiers** or fingerprinting techniques

**Important**: This website analytics is completely separate from the Picmal application, which operates without any analytics whatsoever.

## Software Updates

Picmal may periodically check for software updates through a secure, privacy-preserving process:

- **Minimal Data Exchange**: Only version numbers are transmitted
- **No Personal Information**: No device details or user data is shared  
- **Secure Connections**: All communication uses encrypted HTTPS
- **User Control**: Update checking can be disabled in application settings
- **Transparency**: No hidden data collection during update checks

## Third-Party Services

**None.** Picmal does not integrate with, connect to, or share data with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or cloud storage providers.

## Data Security

Since Picmal processes everything locally without data transmission, your images and information remain under your complete control. We recommend:

### Device Security Best Practices
- Keep your macOS system updated with the latest security patches
- Use appropriate file system permissions for sensitive images
- Enable FileVault disk encryption for additional protection
- Follow standard macOS security guidelines

### Application Security
- Picmal runs in a sandboxed environment for additional security
- No network permissions are requested beyond update checking
- Secure coding practices prevent unauthorized access to your data

## Children's Privacy

Picmal does not collect personal information from users of any age. The application is safe for use by children and families, as all processing occurs locally without any data transmission or online interaction.

## International Users and Data Transfers

Since Picmal processes everything locally on your device, there are **no international data transfer concerns**. Your images and data:

- Never leave your Mac
- Remain within your jurisdiction  
- Stay under your complete control
- Are not subject to cross-border data transfer regulations

## Your Privacy Rights

While traditional data protection rights don't apply (since we don't collect data), you maintain complete control over:

### Full Control
- **All Images**: Complete ownership and control of your processed images
- **Application Settings**: Full control over preferences and configurations  
- **Data Location**: All data remains locally on your device
- **Usage Decisions**: Complete freedom to use or remove the software

### No Account Dependencies
- **No Registration Required**: Use Picmal without creating accounts
